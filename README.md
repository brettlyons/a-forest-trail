Every 10 "steps", prompt the user to "pick berries"

When this button is clicked, give the user a random number of berries between 1 and 10.
Like the above steps, display how many berries a user has, but only after they have at least one berry.
On the left side of the page, display "you picked {X} berries" every time the walk button is clicked.
